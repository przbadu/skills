## Prerequisites

Most skills work out of the box with Claude Code. Some skills require external tools to be installed first.

### agent-browser

The **agent-browser** skill requires the `agent-browser` CLI to be installed. Choose one of the following methods:

**NPM (Recommended)**

```bash
npm install -g agent-browser
agent-browser install  # Downloads Chromium
```

**Homebrew (macOS)**

```bash
brew install agent-browser
agent-browser install  # Downloads Chromium
```

**From Source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser
cd agent-browser
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm build:native  # Requires Rust (https://rustup.rs)
pnpm link --global
agent-browser install
```

**Linux users** — install system dependencies with:

```bash
agent-browser install --with-deps
```

### git-worktree

The **git-worktree** skill requires no extra installation — it uses git's built-in worktree support. Just make sure you have **git 2.5+** installed.

**Usage examples in Claude Code:**

```
# Create a worktree for a new feature
> create a worktree for feature/user-auth

# List existing worktrees
> show my worktrees

# Clean up worktrees whose branches have been merged
> clean up worktrees
```

Worktrees are created under `.worktrees/` in your repo root and automatically added to `.gitignore`.

## Available Hooks

| Hook | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **on-stop.sh** | Stop | Reads the last assistant message aloud using macOS `say` (text-to-speech) |

## Installation

Claude Code discovers skills from `~/.claude/skills/` and hooks from `~/.claude/hooks/`.

```bash
# Clone the repo (if you haven't already)
git clone <repo-url> ~/dev/claude-configs
```

### Install skills

Symlink the entire skills directory so all skills are available across every project:

```bash
ln -s ~/dev/claude-configs/skills ~/.claude/skills
```

To install a single skill instead:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s ~/dev/claude-configs/skills/pdf ~/.claude/skills/pdf
```

### Install hooks

Symlink the hooks directory so all hooks are shared across systems:

```bash
ln -s ~/dev/claude-configs/hooks ~/.claude/hooks
```

Hooks are referenced by path in `~/.claude/settings.json`. The settings file should point to `~/.claude/hooks/<script>`, which resolves through the symlink to the repo. Example settings.json:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/on-stop.sh",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Verify installation

Open Claude Code and type `/` — your installed skills will appear in the autocomplete list. You can invoke any skill directly (e.g., `/pdf`, `/docx`) or let Claude use them automatically based on your request.

## Creating a New Skill

Use the skill-creator to scaffold a new skill:

```bash
python skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

See the [skill-creator SKILL.md](skill-creator/SKILL.md) for the full authoring guide.
