  Review and fix GitHub PR code review comments. Use when the user provides a GitHub Pull Request
  URL and wants to review code review suggestions, analyze their validity, and apply valid fixes
  to the codebase. Triggers on requests like "fix PR review comments", "address code review",
  "review PR feedback", "fix review suggestions on PR #123", or when a GitHub PR URL is shared
  with intent to address review comments. Also triggers on "/pr-review-fixer" or
  "/fix-pr-review".

# PR Review Fixer

Review GitHub PR code review comments, analyze their validity, and apply fixes to the codebase.

## Workflow

1. Extract PR review comments
2. Analyze each comment for validity
3. Apply valid fixes
4. Summarize actions taken

## Step 1: Extract PR Review Comments

Try methods in order until one succeeds:

### Method A: Chrome Browser (preferred)

Use Chrome MCP tools to read the PR page directly:

```
1. Call mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp to get current browser state
2. Call mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp to open a new tab
3. Call mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate to go to the PR URL
4. Navigate to the "Files changed" tab by appending /files to the PR URL
5. Call mcp__claude-in-chrome__get_page_text to extract all review comments
6. If comments are truncated or not fully visible, use mcp__claude-in-chrome__javascript_tool
   to extract structured review data from the DOM
```

JavaScript extraction pattern for GitHub PR review comments:

```javascript
// Extract review comments from GitHub PR Files Changed page
(() => {
  const comments = [];
  document.querySelectorAll('.review-comment, .comment-holder, [id^="discussion_r"]').forEach(el => {
    const file = el.closest('[data-path]')?.getAttribute('data-path')
      || el.closest('.file')?.querySelector('.file-header')?.getAttribute('data-path')
      || 'unknown';
    const body = el.querySelector('.comment-body, .review-comment-contents .markdown-body')?.innerText || '';
    const author = el.querySelector('.author, .timeline-comment-header .author')?.innerText || '';
    const line = el.closest('[data-line]')?.getAttribute('data-line') || '';
    if (body.trim()) {
      comments.push({ file, line, author, body: body.trim() });
    }
  });
  return JSON.stringify(comments, null, 2);
})()
```

### Method B: GitHub CLI (fallback)

Use `gh` CLI to fetch review comments:

```bash
# Extract owner/repo and PR number from the URL
# URL format: https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}
gh pr view {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --json reviews,comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews
```

Parse the JSON output to extract:
- File path and line numbers for each comment
- Comment body (the review suggestion)
- Comment author
- Whether it's a single comment, review comment, or part of a review thread

### Method C: GitHub MCP Tools (secondary fallback)

Use GitHub MCP tools:

```
mcp__github__get_pull_request_comments for inline review comments
mcp__github__get_pull_request_reviews for review summaries
mcp__github__get_pull_request_files for list of changed files
mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff for the full diff
```

## Step 2: Analyze Each Review Comment

For each extracted comment, determine:

1. **Is it actionable?** Skip comments that are:
   - Questions or discussions without a clear fix
   - Approvals or positive feedback ("LGTM", "looks good")
   - Already resolved/outdated comments

2. **Is the suggestion valid?** Read the relevant file and surrounding context:
   - Read the file referenced in the comment
   - Understand the broader context (function purpose, patterns used)
   - Evaluate if the suggestion improves correctness, readability, performance, or security
   - Check if the suggestion conflicts with existing project patterns or conventions

3. **Categorize the comment:**
   - **Valid fix**: The suggestion is correct and should be applied
   - **Partially valid**: The intent is correct but implementation should differ
   - **Invalid/Skip**: The suggestion is incorrect, already handled, or not applicable
   - **Needs discussion**: Requires user input before proceeding

Present the analysis to the user in a summary table before applying any fixes:

```
| # | File | Comment | Category | Reasoning |
|---|------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | path/to/file.rb:42 | "Use guard clause" | Valid fix | Improves readability |
| 2 | path/to/file.rb:78 | "Add nil check" | Invalid | Already handled by L75 |
| 3 | path/to/service.rb:15 | "Extract method" | Needs discussion | Multiple approaches |
```

**Wait for user confirmation** before proceeding to apply fixes. The user may override
categorizations or skip specific comments.

## Step 3: Apply Valid Fixes

For each confirmed valid fix:

1. Read the full file to understand context
2. Apply the fix using Edit tool with precise old_string/new_string
3. Verify the fix doesn't break surrounding code
4. If the fix is complex or affects multiple files, apply changes incrementally

**Guidelines:**
- Follow existing code style and patterns in the project
- Respect project conventions from CLAUDE.md or similar config
- When a review suggests a pattern change, check if similar patterns exist elsewhere
  and only fix the specific instance mentioned (don't over-apply)
- For suggestions involving new imports/dependencies, verify they exist in the project

## Step 4: Summarize Actions

After applying all fixes, provide a summary:

```
## PR Review Fix Summary

### Applied Fixes
- [file:line] Description of change (from reviewer comment)

### Skipped Comments
- [file:line] Reason for skipping

### Needs Discussion
- [file:line] Why user input is needed

### Next Steps
- Run tests to verify changes
- Commit and push changes
```
